Rough draft of scenarios based on post it notes from Oct 4th Cognoma meetup (Yianna serving as our cancer biologist subject matter expert):

Goal is to massage these into a human centered scenarios, editing as necessary, then “test” and iterate these with other cancer biologists.

## Scenario 1 (top row of post its):

1. It’s 10am on Tuesday, and Yianni is working at his bench.
+ He says hello to Cognoma.
+ Cognoma tells him the type of things he can help with.
+ Measure the impact of mutation in NFI.
+ Sequence -> Bioinformatician -> Pipeline -> Excel results.
+ He gives the excel file that includes sample mutations to Cognoma.
+ He tells Cognoma that the disease is Melanoma.
+ He asks Cognoma what type of samples it has.
+ Cognoma tells him…???
+ He tells Cognoma he is interested in the importance of certain mutations in the panel.
+ [What type of mutation?].
+ [Uveal vs skin cutaneous?].
+ [Xenografts vs cell lines vs human tumors].

## Scenario 2 (bottom row of post its):

1. It’s 10am on Tuesday, and Yianni is working at his bench.
+ He says hello to Cognoma.
+ Cognoma tells him the type of things he can help with.
+ [Q61k in melanoma NRAS].
+ [He asks Cognoma] how many samples have Q61K?
+ [Melanoma skin vs uveal vs other cancer types?].
+ Cognoma tells him it is building a classifier (NRAS).
+ [Cognoma shows him?] performance (tissue, gene, specific mutation) [of the classifier?].
+ [Cognoma shows him?] cooccurence of mutations in those samples.
+ He asks Cognoma what kind of treatments have these samples received?
+ Cognoma shows him sample attributes with prediction score [e.g. treatment mutations?].
